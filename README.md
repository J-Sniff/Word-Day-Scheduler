# The workDay Scheduler

The work day scheduler is here to help you stay more organized during your busy workday. Just a click away and you can quickly see what is coming up in the next hour.
Keep it with you to stay ahead of the game.

##Key Features

This scheduler provides you with the current date and time. It also allows you to edit and save your tasks so you never get confused. One of the nice features it has is that it will stay up to date with the current hour and change the date line to show you the past, present, and future hours.

## Getting started

To get started let's go to the [page](https://j-sniff.github.io/challenge5-Word-Day-Scheduler/). Once you have arrived to the application you will quickly notice that it displays the current time and has the work day hours color coded based off the current hour. Here is an example picture below.
